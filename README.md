# plsql-tic-tac-toe
Created Tic Tac Toe game with three gameplay demos using PL/SQL as part of Data Management and Database Design class. 
The stored procedures are to be compiled first, followed by the function. The demo file contains the script for three full gameplays along with some "errors" to showcase exception handling.
